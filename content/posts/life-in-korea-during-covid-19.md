Hey, thanks for visiting my blog. Hope you like the small tribute to one of my favorite video games of all time, Street Fighter 2.

Because COVID-19 has taken over the world, it was a good time to pause and restart my blog-journey. The social distancing thing has been extremely easy for me, as I’ve pretty much been living in the cloud and socially distant for the past few years. I guess I was preparing for (non-alcoholic) Corona all this time. Being in South Korea during the global corona-virus outbreak has been pretty interesting. I’ve been following the news here and from the US, and it’s been interesting to see the differences in how people have reacted. I’ve noticed some positive changes here in Korea. Some of them subtle, some of them big. Hopefully, the positive changes will stick and stay around. I’ll be upfront and say that Americans are a lot more germaphobic than Koreans. Most public bathrooms I go to in Korea do not have soap, or they have bar soap that’s supposed to be shared by thousands of people. (I recommend carrying around a small bottle of hand-soap if you plan on coming here). But the COVID-19 response campaigns from government and media are definitely working. People are obsessively washing their hands. Almost all the bathrooms have seen upgrades. From no soap to some form of soap, or bar soap to auto-soap dispensers, the virus definitely caught the attention of Korea.

Second, the amount of hand sanitizer went from zero to everywhere. Big malls and stores, tiny cafes, restaurants are all making sanitizer available. Of course, Korea was already the world leader in mask supplies because of its environmental challenges with yellow dust and fine dust, and add to that a solid national health care system - makes sense that Korea (perhaps surprisingly to those in the West) was well prepared for this pandemic. While the Shincheonji cult-church story made headlines and was a cause for concern, I personally have not seen any panic here. I’m relieved that grocery shelves aren’t being emptied out and hoarded like in America. People seem to be calm and almost normal. We've been taking the kids to playgrounds and families are out enjoying the great weather, of course, with masks on. These days, I'm only going out to coffee shops a few times a week, and while not as busy as it used to be, people are still enjoying their coffee.

The Korean government is slowly reopening public facilities and schools, and it looks like Korea's approach for returning to normal will be a multi-step, methodical plan. Read about [Korea's Ministry of Education and their plan for students and teachers](http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20200505000201).

The number of new cases is dropping daily, and everyone in the world is wondering how Korea kept its testing efforts up while not running into shortages of health care workers or equipment. Considering Korea's dense population, it is incredible that as of March 23, less than 9000 confirmed cases have been reported. (And as of May 7th, 10,810 cases).

Meanwhile back home in the US, Team America seems to be struggling to find enough masks, beds, ventilators, medical workers, and testing kits. As much as I want to visit family and eat some tacos and pizza, I am going to socially distance myself from America until I see some positive news. I’m also seeing a lot of stories of hate and aggression towards Asian-Americans and Asians. So I’m in no hurry and I’ll wait for things to settle down.

I am optimistic that the global community of scientists and researchers will find a way to slow this thing down. Hope you are safe and healthy wherever you are.

Thanks for reading.

I'm not the biggest fan of seafood. I'm more of a burgers/tacos/pizza (typical American) guy. But when my in-laws invite us to dinner, it is usually to a seafood place, where we go all out on a massive assortment of underwater delicacies. Raw, cooked, familiar, and unfamiliar animals. That's how Koreans do it.

At Dong-Hae-Hoet-Jip (동해횟집), located in Incheon near GanSeok (간석) Station, you can reserve a private room for families and small parties. There are no chairs in these rooms, so you have to eat the traditional way, sitting on the floor.

Most of the menu choices are for family-sized multi-course meals. Your server will probably be a kind ahjummah (Korean lady) that brings out fish and side items (반찬) every 5-10 minutes.

Our meal included grilled tuna, lobster topped with cheese, several plates of raw fish, cooked fish. I really really liked the peppers-crab-meat-cucumbers dipped in hot mustard sauce and the fish eggs in seaweed cones. They were out of this world delicious! Korea has seafood places like this everywhere, so you don't have to go out to Incheon to experience this kind of meal. You will leave full and satisfied.

I'm not the biggest fan of seafood. I'm more of a burgers/tacos/pizza (typical American) guy. But when my in-laws invite us to dinner, it is usually to a seafood place, where we go all out on plate after plate of underwater delicacies. Raw, cooked, familiar, and unfamiliar animals. That's how Koreans do it.

At -----, located in Incheon near GanSeok Station, you can reserve a private room for families and small parties. There are no chairs in these rooms, so you have to eat the traditional way, on the floor.

Most of the menu choices are for fmaily-sized multi-course meals.
